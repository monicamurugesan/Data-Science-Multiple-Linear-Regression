# Data-Science-Multiple-Linear-Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.


In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression that involves more than one explanatory variable.

  
yi =β0+β1*xi1+β2*xi2+...+β 
pxip+ϵ
where, for i=n observations:
yi=dependent variable
xi=expanatory variables
β0=y-intercept (constant term)
βp=slope coefficients for each explanatory variable
ϵ=the model’s error term (also known as the residuals)
